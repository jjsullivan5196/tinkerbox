# Tinkerbox - Jupyter Kernel running inside Thinkbox Deadline

![Dialog Example](contrib/dialog.png)

This package shims the ipython jupyter kernel into Deadline's python sandbox,
allowing you to interactively run Deadline client code inside of Jupyter
Notebooks. The shim starts the regular `ipykernel` inside of `deadlinecommand`,
which has access to the entire Deadline client API, including the repository and
graphical user interface.

## Getting Started

### Install `ipykernel` in Deadline

Before you can use the kernel, the `ipykernel` package needs to be in Deadline's
load path. The easiest way to source the package is by using `pip` directly,
specifying Deadline's internal python version (at the time of writing, Deadline
10.1.23.6 uses Python 3.7.12) and a location to put the needed packages. For
example, on a linux installation:

```bash
# Make a separate site-packages folder so we don't get things mixed up
mkdir -p /opt/Thinkbox/Deadline10/extra/lib/python3.7/site-packages

# Add the extra location to Deadline's load path locally
echo '/opt/Thinkbox/Deadline10/extra/lib/python3.7/site-packages' > /opt/Thinkbox/Deadline10/lib/python3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/jupyter.pth

# Install ipykernel
python3 -m pip install \
--python-version 3.7.12 \
--only-binary=:all: \
--target /opt/Thinkbox/Deadline10/extra/lib/python3.7/site-packages \
ipykernel==6.15.3
```
Note that for the above script to work, the Client installation will need to be world read-writable.

TODO: Install docs for other platforms

### Install the shim package

Install this package as a git dependency, via `pip` or `pipenv` with
`git+https://github.com/jjsullivan5196/tinkerbox.git#egg=tinkerbox`

Once installed, the kernel spec will be available for use by jupyter. Start
`jupyter-lab` as normal and create a new notebook, or copy one from the
`examples/` folder to start with.

Everything in the [Deadline Scripting Manual](https://docs.thinkboxsoftware.com/products/deadline/10.1/1_User%20Manual/manual/index-scripting.html) applies within notebooks using
this kernel.

## Known issues
- The kernel uses Deadline's python environment wholesale, in particular
  `sys.executable` ends up being `deadlinecommand.dll` since it's the program
  hosting the interpreter. This might potentially cause issues for libraries
  that depend on the interpreter being executable for things like
  `subprocess`. So far, only debugpy has needed a monkeypatch to work, this may
  change in the future.

## TODO

- Add configuration for starting the kernel in different repositories
